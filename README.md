# Game1: Click as Many Objects as You Can Within the Time Frame

Game1 is a fun and interactive 2D game built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to practice basic object-oriented programming concepts in C++. The development of this game was inspired by Suraj Sharma's instructional videos on YouTube.

## Game Features
Game1 challenges your focus and speed in an exciting 2D environment. The objective is to click on as many objects as possible to earn points within a limited time. Points vary depending on the size of the objects, offering a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

1. Click on objects to gain points. Larger objects yield fewer points, while smaller objects are worth more.
2. You are allowed to miss up to 20 objects. Missing more than 20 objects will end the game.
3. The game requires quick reflexes and sharp focus to maximize your score within the given time frame.
